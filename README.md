# MultithreadingExperimentations
 
Hello there!

My Multithread experimentations came very simple at the end, so this Read Me should be pretty short.

First I only tried to print threads ID as well as thread counts.
Then while reading lessons as they came, I decided to take this tutorial that explains the basics of multithreading very well:
https://thispointer.com/category/c/c-11/c11-threads/

I did the different objectives of the two pages up to the last ones from 'Part 9' to 'How to terminate a thread', 
except 'How to get ID' & 'How to create vectors of thread objects'.
I mixed those with my first tests.


This is it.
Everything is in the project, you have to comment/uncomment the functions in the main to test them.
The first uncommented one is the first - and very simple - thread test, and so on.
I tried to add as much comments as possible.

If I had some more time before my meetings, I would have liked to finish this websites exercices.
I would like instead to finish them in my spare time.

Sorry if the last project is not that clean nor that complex, multithreading wasn't my cup of tea in 1st year so I started all again from scratch with it.

Well, enjoy it anyway!
